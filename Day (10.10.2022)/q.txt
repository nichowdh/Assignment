In this example, you have a base class Teacher and a 
sub class ITTeacher. Since class ITTeacher extends the designation
and college properties and work () method from base class,
we need not to declare these properties and method in sub class.
Here we have college Name, designation and work () method 
which are common to all the teachers so we have 
declared them in the base class,this way the child classes 
like Math Teacher, Music Teacher and PhysicsTeacher 
do not need to write this code and can be used directly 
from base class.
